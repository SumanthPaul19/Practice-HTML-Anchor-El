         <h1>My Favorite Cities</h1> 
        <hr>
        <p>City is a human settlement, a dominant characteristic of which is that unlike a little community, it is not self-sufficient. This is a basic characteristic of all kinds of cities – archaic or modern. Inhabitants of cities are not able to feed themselves entirely from the food produced within the bounds of the city area.</p>
        <p>In the context of old cities, this feature had greater significance as the cities were mostly walled and thus the term ‘entirely’ refers to the food produced only within the boundary of the city. Today, with a considerable degree of urbanization, the quality of self-sufficiency holds no significance as not even villages, what to say of cities, are really self-sufficient. As the economy advances, the degree of self-sufficiency is reduced and interde­pendence is increased. </p>
        <p>Some of my favorite cities are :</p>
